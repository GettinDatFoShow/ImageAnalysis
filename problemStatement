  Today, our lives are intermingled with the digital world. A world full of messages, on-line profiles, cellular communication, personal documents, and everyone trying to capture their everyday lives with photos. With all of this data, a problem arises. We have to buy and build more storage. With this problem constantly growing, it is important that we design systems and software to help us better manage this data. We at Team Image Analysis have decided to tackle one area of this problem before it begins. As photos come enter ones mobile device, personal computer, or cloud storage, they will pass through a layer of software designed to analyze each one. During this analysis, the images will be studied as if the individual were using their own eyes. Each image will be compared to existing images in the users database and dealt with according to the parameters he or she has set. This software can inform the user of an existing image that is similar along with the data that shows this conclusion and even automatically remove the one of the images. By better managing images and funny memes that we send and receive from our friends, we may never lose a memory because of full storage.
